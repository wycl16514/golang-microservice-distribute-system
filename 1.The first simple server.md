The backend system behide the simple front page of goole is gigantic and powerful like the monster of Gozilla. Such extremely sophisticated system is not come into being at first hand.
Like all creatures of our world, they are all enovle from a very simple form as a single cell. Since we want to design a powerful system that can coordinate thounsands of machines into
one to complete any complicated task, we need to know how to create and mantain a single server on a single machine, this is just like we will push the evolution of an advanced creature from a single cell.

Let's quickly build a simple hello world server as with gRPC following, first we need to install protocol buffer on your machine, its 
functionality is to convert the API interfaces between client and server into code for given language, it supports almost every programming
language, I found the best way to explain programming idear is by programming itself, therefore let's do it, on Mac you can use following
command to install it:

```go


brew install protobuf

#verify it
protoc --version
```

For windows, you can use chocolatey, open powershell then :
```go
# 1. install Chocolatey（if you don't have it）
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# 2. install protobuf
choco install protoc

# 3. verify
protoc --version
```

For linux, using APT would be following way:
```go
# 1.
sudo apt update

# 2. install protobuf
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler

# 3. verify
protoc --version
```

If you are using yum, then do the following:
```go
# 1. =
sudo yum install -y autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip

# 2. download and compile
curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v26.1/protobuf-26.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf protobuf-26.1.tar.gz
cd protobuf-26.1
./configure
make
sudo make install

# 3. update link
sudo ldconfig

# 4.verify
protoc --version

```

Since we are using the go language, we need to install two more modules as following:
```go
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

After you successfully installing protocol buffer, the first step is to define the communicating interface between client and server.If you
are familiar with restful API, you may define what kind of json you will get or post between client and server, for gRPC, the json just turn
into binary data and the communicating speed is much faster.

When the environment is ready, we will begin to create a simple application, the client sends a user id then the server will return info for user with the given id. Such application are 
most often to be done by using restful API, now we see how to do it by using grpc. First let's define the interfaces between the client and server, that is to define the data structures 
for the communication of client and server.
